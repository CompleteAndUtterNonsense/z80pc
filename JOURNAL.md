This is my journal of the design and building process of **z80 PC**.

## 10/4/2025 - Researched and Started Initial Design  

I started out with the design and research for components to build my Z80 PC around. I firstly wanted to tackle the RAM, ROM, and Oscillator. Since the Z80 is legacy hardware that can't be found as easily as before, I decided to check on eBay for the most common/cheapest model of Z80, which seemed to be the Z084000xP models, which are also called Z8400. I wanted to in a sense, splurge, as currently we are able to access small, SMD components with amazing specs for the Z80 era for pretty cheap prices, and so I outfitted it with SMD chips for RAM and ROM (256KBit each) with the maximum specs the Z80 could drive. I also decided to research the options for video output, as I really don't want to deal with an analog signal, and I've now theorized that I can build a digital output by using an MCU with a video output like DVI or HDMI since the Z80 sends the characters on its screen at the moment. I am a bit confused on how I should wire up decoupling capacitors in this case because I don't have great documentation for these more obscure components.
